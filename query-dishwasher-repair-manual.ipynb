      "index: ('Chapter_4', 190) [0]   There are two general areas where you will commonly find water leaking from a dishwasher. The first is from around the door; water will generally show up on the kitchen floor in front of the dishwasher. The second is from some component under the tub. The most common sources are pump seals and water valves, though it really can come from just about anything else under there, such as heater mounts, float switches, dryer fans, hoses, etc.\n",
      "index: ('Chapter_2', 81) [1]   POOR WASH QUALITY: This is the most common complaint in a dishwasher. It covers a lot of different specific symptoms, from spotting, film or etching of the dishes to food left on dishes. It is discussed in detail in Chapter 3. NO POWER; MOTOR WON'T START: First check the house breaker or fuse. Next, make sure that the dishwasher is plugged into the correct wall socket. (See the note in section 5-2 for an explanation)\n",
      "index: ('Chapter_4', 191) [2]   A slow, under-tub leak may go years without being detected. Often the tile or linoleum in front of the dishwasher is slightly raised, and water does not flow uphill. A slow leak beneath the tub can rot a wooden floor or cabinetry. It can also cause odors, mildew, etc. Often the first sign you might see is water leaking under the cabinetry and into the space beneath the kitchen sink.\n",
      "index: ('Chapter_3', 145) [3]   NOTE: This Chapter assumes that the motor is running and you hear water whooshing around inside the machine! If not, go back to chapter 2 and troubleshoot ! Poor wash quality mainly involves heavy spotting and filming or etching of the dishes. It can usually be traced to cold water or excessively hot, hard or soft water, poor detergent, or inadequate drying. Washing dishes in a dishwasher is not just a matter of blowing hot water at them. It is not just simply a mechanical or hydraulic process. It is also a chemical process. The chemicals you use in your dishwasher, from detergent to rinse agent, are extremely critical. And the temperature of the water that dissolves and carries these chemicals is critical as well.\n",
      "index: ('Chapter_1', 2) [4]   The main reason dishwashers exist is that they allow dishes to be washed in water much hotter than you can use when washing dishes by hand. This allows greater grease-cutting and sterilization of the dishes. They are NOT made to operate under cold water conditions or to ingest your disgusting, moldy leftovers, no matter what the sales literature says. And using cheap soap and hard water (without making some adjustments) can shorten their lives considerably.\n"

      "*  Sometimes you can eliminate possibilities just simply be studying the wiring diagram for a few minutes. For example, let's say your timer is not advancing during any cycle. Following the gray line in figure 6-C, the timer is fed through three different circuits. Sometimes it gets its power through timer switch 22, sometimes it gets power from switch \"D\" inside the pushbutton selector switch, and it can also get power from the thermostat. It is unlikely that all three switches are bad, so the likelihood is that the timer motor itself is on the fritz.\n",
      "*  You should see continuity make and break at least once in the cycle; usually several times. If it doesn't, the internal contacts are bad; replace the timer. Repeat the process with the test leads between the W-V and the O-BK terminals. You can drive yourself crazy trying to figure out just exactly when during the cycle the switch is supposed to open and close. Leave that to the design engineers. Just satisfy yourself that the switch is, indeed, opening and closing at some time during the cycle.\n",
      "*  STARTING DRAIN CYCLE: Cold water can kill your wash quality. (see Chapter 3) So before letting any hot water into the tub, we must make sure the tub has no cold water left in it from the last wash. Therefore, in most designs, a new wash cycle starts with the pump operating for a minute or so in the \"drain\" mode. FILL CYCLE: An electric solenoid fill valve then opens to let hot water into the tub. The timer controls how long the solenoid valve stays open, which controls the water level. A flow-control washer built into the valve compensates for variations in the water supply pressure.\n",
      "*  TIMER DIAGNOSIS: If the timer drive motor is not advancing only in certain cycles, there may be a switch or thermostat that feeds it that is bad. See the example in section 6-1 and figure 6-C. If the timer is not advancing in all cycles, well, that's pretty obvious. Replace the timer or timer drive motor, or have it rebuilt as described below. Timers can be difficult to diagnose. The easiest way is to go through everything else in the system that's malfunctioning. If none of the other components are bad, then it may be the timer.\n",

It is not just simply a mechanical or hydraulic process. It is also a chemical process. The chemicals you use in your dishwasher, from detergent to rinse agent, are extremely critical. And the temperature of the water that dissolves and carries these chemicals is critical as well.\n",

The wrong soap can cause suds, which can leak out even if the seals are good. There are also some designs which can develop a water jet that blows water past the door seal; this is discussed in Chapter 4. Check for these problems first. If you still suspect the door seal, try cleaning any accumulated detergent or other gunk from it. If you need to replace the seals, your parts dealer has a door seal kit.

      "*  If water is coming from beneath the machine, it is usually coming from pump seals, but it could also be coming from a hose or from the fill or drain solenoid valve. Remove the kickplate and operate the machine while looking beneath it. Try to isolate the leak by watching where the water drips on the floor. Remember that there are live wires under there; don't stick your hands in there while the machine is plugged in. Diagnose and repair as described in chapters 4 or 5.\n",

      "*  If they genuinely try to help you fix it yourself, and you find that you're unable to, they may be the best place to look for service. Here's a hot tip: after what I just said, if they sold you this book, then I'll just about guarantee they're genuinely interested in helping do-it-yourselfers. When you go into the store, have ready the make, model and serial number from the nameplate of the dishwasher.\n",
      "*  Find yourself a good appliance parts dealer. You can find them in the yellow pages under the following headings: â¢ Appliances, Household, Major â¢ Appliances, Parts and Supplies â¢ Dishwashers, Domestic â¢ Appliances, Household, Repair and Service Call a few of them and ask if they are a dishwasher repair service, or if they sell parts, or both. Ask them if they offer free advice with the parts they sell (Occasionally, stores that offer both parts and service will not want to give you advice.) Often the parts counter men are ex-technicians who got tired of the pressures of in-home service. They can be your best friends. However, you don't want to badger them with too many questions, so know your basics before you start asking questions.\n",
      "*  Some parts houses may offer service, too. Be careful! There may be a conflict of interest. They may try to talk you out of even trying to fix your own dishwasher. They'll tell you it's too complicated, then in the same breath \"guide\" you to their service department. Who are you gonna believe, me or them? Not all service and parts places are this way, however. If you observe such buildup, periodically put about 1/4 to 1/2 cup of \"Lime-Away\"â¢ or Citric Acid (usually available at drugstores) in the machine and run it through a wash cycle, with or without dishes. Repeat as often as necessary.\n",
      "*  Your appliance parts dealer has an impeller and seal kit for these machines. OLDER MODELS: The pump is disassembled in place, without removing the motor.: Once the pump has been disassembled, the motor can be removed with the machine in place, but it can be a difficult job. The screws are hard to get to. Try it, but if you have too much trouble, pull out the machine. TECH TIPS: These are pretty straightforward machines to tear down and rebuild. Note carefully how everything comes off and in what order.\n",
